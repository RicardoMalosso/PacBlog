# Adding a music post

Use this recipe for “create a new post for this YouTube video”. Read this guide once; it contains the template and supported syntax. Read one existing post only if needed: `cais.en.md` for a minimal page or `construcao.en.md` for article formatting, both under `content/music/`. Read implementation files (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mjs`) only to diagnose a failure or implement new behavior. Avoid repeated repository scans and unrelated research.

## Inputs and defaults

- **YouTube link only:** identify artist, song title, and duration; fetch synchronized lyrics from LRCLIB; translate to the other language; create the page.
- **Link + one LRC:** preserve it and translate its text, keeping timestamps identical.
- **Link + both LRCs:** use them directly after checking their language and alignment.
- **Article supplied:** use it as the body. Otherwise write just one explanatory sentence and the player—no invented essay or personal experiences.

Default to English and Portuguese pages unless a specific locale is requested. Both pages use the same two LRC files. English titles must include both original and translated titles: `Construção (Construction) — Chico Buarque`. For an English original, include its Portuguese title translation. Preserve existing slugs and dates when updating a post.

## Fetch missing lyrics

Identify the song from the actual YouTube recording; the uploader is not necessarily the artist. Normalize its URL to `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`.

Query LRCLIB with URL-encoded values:

```text
https://lrclib.net/api/get?artist_name=ARTIST&track_name=TITLE&duration=SECONDS
```

If no suitable result is returned, search:

```text
https://lrclib.net/api/search?track_name=TITLE&artist_name=ARTIST
```

Album is optional. Select a matching recording with nonempty `syncedLyrics`. Save that decoded string as UTF-8 LRC, not JSON. `plainLyrics` has no timing. Video intros/outros and live versions can affect the duration match; check synchronization near the beginning, middle, and end. If no suitable timed lyrics exist, report that and request an LRC; never invent timestamps. Honor API retry instructions. Reference: https://lrclib.net/docs

Each file contains only its own language. Translate faithfully, preserving cue order, repetition, and every timestamp. Example: `[00:12.34]Lyric text`. The current parser ignores `[offset:...]` metadata. Save assets locally; published posts need no LRCLIB requests.

## Files and complete template

Create `content/music/<slug>.en.md` and, when applicable, `<slug>.pt-br.md`. Put lyrics at `public/lyrics/<slug>/en.lrc` and `public/lyrics/<slug>/pt-br.lrc`.

```markdown
---
title: "Original Title (English Title) — Artist"
description: "Artist — Original Title, with synchronized Portuguese and English lyrics."
slug: "song-slug"
locale: "en"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
tags: ["Lyrics"]
draft: false
artist: "Artist"
originalLanguage: "pt-BR"
player:
  youtubeUrl: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
  subtitles:
    en: "lyrics/song-slug/en.lrc"
    pt-br: "lyrics/song-slug/pt-br.lrc"
---
Original Title by Artist, with Portuguese lyrics and an English translation.

<!-- lyrics-player -->
```

Replace all placeholders. For Portuguese, localize title, description, body, and tags as appropriate; set `locale: "pt-br"`. Keep slug, date, video, and lyric paths shared.

- Required fields: `title`, `description`, `slug`, `locale`, and quoted publication `date`. Use today's Brazilian date for a new post unless specified.
- Slugs use lowercase ASCII letters/numbers and hyphens. Routes are `/PacBlog/<locale>/music/<slug>/`; no manual route registration is needed.
- `description` appears in the header, listing, and SEO metadata. Keep it concise.
- `tags` drive visible labels and filters. Reuse relevant existing spelling/capitalization, e.g. `MPB`, `Lyrics`, `Brazilian music`.
- `artist` displays the performer. `originalLanguage` records the source language; it does not change the player's supported EN/PT pair.
- Optional `credits: "Verified songwriting, performance, or translation credits."` displays plain text after the player/article.
- `draft: true` excludes the page from publication. Both subtitle paths must exist, relative to `public/`, without a leading slash.
- Use one player marker, outside panels/notes/code. Without it, the player follows the body. Existing controls and responsive styling apply automatically.
- Legacy inline `lyrics` metadata is unnecessary for normal new posts. There are no supported per-post cover, offset, or player-layout fields; don't invent them.

## Article formatting, only when needed

Use normal Markdown: `##` headings, emphasis, lists, tables, links, images, and code. Raw HTML is disabled.

Short mouseover:

```markdown
A [term](#note "Short explanation.").
A [term](# An explanation with **Markdown** and (balanced parentheses)).
```

Long mouseover:

```markdown
A [term](#note-context).

:::note context
A **Markdown** explanation, with paragraphs or lists.
:::
```

Use unique note IDs. Keep the reference and definition on the same side of the player marker. Define notes outside panels. Inline `(# ...)` syntax requires whitespace after `#` and balanced parentheses. Dotted underlines, positioning, keyboard/tap behavior, and the desktop arrow hint are automatic.

Collapsed supplementary section:

```markdown
:::panel-collapsed More about this song
Additional **Markdown** content.
:::
```

Use `:::panel Title` to start open. Do not nest panels or place the player inside one. The expand dialog is automatic.

Images belong in `public/images/`, referenced as `![Useful alt text](/PacBlog/images/file.ext)`. Internal links include the base and locale: `[Related song](/PacBlog/en/music/apesar-de-voce/)`. Add sources, related songs, or contextual sections only when supplied or requested.

## Validate

Run `npm run build` then `npm test` with dependencies installed. Check both requested routes, titles, lyric languages/timing, and any formatting used. Inspect the diff for placeholders and unrelated edits. Do not modify player code for ordinary content additions.

During development, run `npm run content` or restart `npm run dev` after Markdown edits. Never edit generated JSON or `dist/` directly. Commit source Markdown and lyrics; follow the user's publishing instructions. Summarize changed pages and checks briefly.
